**Title**: Investigating the Determinants of Support for Switzerland's 2024 Public Pension Scheme Referendum

**Abstract**:
This project employs logistic regression and random forest models to investigate the municipal-level determinants of the 2024 Swiss constitutional referendum, which approved an increase in public pension schemes despite unclear funding and opposition. The analysis focuses on variables like political orientation, economic status, age demographics, tax burden, linguistic region, and municipalities' degree of urbanicity. The degree of support for the socialist party, region of residence, and local tax burdens are highlighted as the key predictors of support for Swiss pension reforms. This research contributes to understanding voter behaviour in pension reform contexts, offering insights for future campaigns and policy-making.
